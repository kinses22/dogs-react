# Dog App

A React application to display dogs and be able to favorite them for viewing on another page.
## Assumptions

- all media types coming back from api were to be included
- No mention of undoing favoriting on the home page
  (could have a boolean to change from add to remove)

## Future Considerations

Unfortunately I didn't have enough time to get around to everything and had no previous
experience with react, the following are my considerations for the future;

- Filter for duplicate images while fetching dog images.
- Potentially filter out mp4 as I was unsure if mp4 met requirement.
- Ability to click to remove favorite on home page, currently just add.
- Add more tests, having little react experience, I had to learn as much as I could
  to get the main requirements done. I manually tested it, but I would add many more tests.
- Tidy up code into smaller functions to render JSX if I had more time.

## How to Run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
